# Blood-Bank-Management
This website acts like a medium/an intermediate between hospitals/clinics and donors/receivers. In this project we have two users: Donors/Receivers and Hospitals/Clinics(Doctors). TheÂ  Hospital user can add blood sample to their blood bank, request for blood, check status of their request, update their details.
